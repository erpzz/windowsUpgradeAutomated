This is a two-part series of scripts designed to upgrade our computers from Windows 11 Home to Windows 11 Pro and activate the new version using a volume license key.

Script 1: In-Place Upgrade (inPlaceUpgrade.ps1) 
Purpose: This script upgrades our computers from Windows 11 Home to Windows 11 Pro using a special file called an ISO.

What It Does
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prompts for the ISO Path: The script prompts the user to enter the path to the Windows 11 Pro ISO file.
Starts the Upgrade: It begins the upgrade process to change your Windows 11 Home to Windows 11 Pro. 
Logs the Process: The script keeps a record of what it's doing, which helps us if something goes wrong. 
Restarts the Computer: After the upgrade, the script restarts your computer to make sure everything is set up correctly.

Script 2: Activation (postUpgradeActivation.ps1)
Purpose: This script activates the new Windows 11 Pro version on your computer using a volume license key.

What It Does
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prompts for the Activation Key: The script prompts the user to enter the volume license key to activate Windows 11 Pro. Logs the Process: The script keeps a record of what itâ€™s doing.
Restarts the Computer (Optional): After activating, the script can restart your computer to ensure all settings are properly applied.
Why These Scripts are Necessary OEM Conflicts with Volume License Keys: When our computers come pre-installed with Windows 11 Home, they often use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) licenses. 
These OEM licenses are tied to the specific hardware and can introduce conflicts when attempting to upgrade and activate the system with a volume license key. Volume license keys are used for bulk licensing across multiple devices within our organization.

Key Issues with OEM Licenses
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware Binding: OEM licenses are tied to the specific hardware, making it difficult to reuse or upgrade. Upgrade Restrictions: Directly upgrading from an OEM Home edition to Pro with a volume license key can result in conflicts and activation issues. 
By using an in-place upgrade with an ISO file, we can bypass these conflicts and ensure a smooth transition from Windows 11 Home to Windows 11 Pro. This method ensures that the system is properly upgraded and ready for activation with our volume license key.

Why We Use These Scripts 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automation: These scripts automate the upgrade and activation process, saving us time and reducing the chances of human error.
Logging: By keeping a record of the process, we can easily troubleshoot any issues that might arise.
Consistency: Using scripts ensures that every computer is upgraded and activated in the same way.
